# AA Engine — Forecasting → Black–Litterman → Backtester (Skeleton)

This is a *scaffold* for your research-to-production pipeline:
- Part 1: XGBoost forecaster
- Part 2: Black–Litterman optimizer
- Part 3: Historical backtester

> Intentionally minimal. Fill modules incrementally; keep functions pure and add tests as you go.
